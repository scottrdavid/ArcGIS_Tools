# A collection of GIS tools.

I have recently realized I have a collection of tools I have written or edited/combined from online resources for use in my research. I am working on getting all of those codes cleaned up and uploaded here. 

Hopefully they are of help. 

If you have questions you can find my contact info on my research website www.scottrdavid.com


## I wll update with a handfull of tools soon:
List of things to include:
3-4 detrending methods (& a matlab based one I need to convert to python one using gaussian filters), centerline extraction tools,
line discritization tool---a simple version --a better version of this code for river attribution will be released in a differnt toolkit.

And whatever else I find digging through old hard drives...
