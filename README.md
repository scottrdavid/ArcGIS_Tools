# A collection of GIS tools.

I have recently realized I have a collection of tools I have written or edited/combined from online resources for use in my research. I am working on getting all of those codes cleaned up and uploaded here. 

Hopefully they are of help. 

If you have questions you can find my contact info on my research website www.scottrdavid.com


## I will update with a handful of tools soon:
List of things to include:
3-4 detrending methods (& a matlab based one using Gaussian filters I need to convert to python), centerline extraction tools, a line discretization tool---a simple version --a better version of this code for river attribution will be released in a different toolkit. And whatever else I find digging through old hard drives...
